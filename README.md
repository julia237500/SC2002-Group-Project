=======
## Title: BTO System

This project simulates a Build-To-Order (BTO) system, similar to the real-world HDB BTO process. It allows **applicants** to apply for housing projects, and provides **HDB officers** and **managers** tools to manage these projects.  
The system is written entirely in **plain Java**, without the use of any external libraries, frameworks, or databases.

---

## Key Design Features

1. **Adherence to SOLID Principles**  
   The system is structured according to the five SOLID object-oriented design principles to ensure maintainability, scalability, and clarity.

2. **MVC Architecture**  
   Implements the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate application logic, user interface, and data handling responsibilities.

3. **Command Pattern**  
   Encapsulates requests as objects, allowing flexible command processing, queuing, and undo operations if needed.

4. **Manual Dependency Injection**  
   A custom dependency injector is implemented to handle object instantiation and wiring without relying on external frameworks.

5. **In-Memory Data Manager**  
   Acts like a lightweight databaseâ€”data is managed in memory during runtime and persisted to files for loading and saving.
