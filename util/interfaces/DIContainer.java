/**
 * Design Principles involved:
 * 1. Inversion of Control (IoC) Principle:
 * - Instead of the application creating and managing its dependencies directly, 
 * - it delegates that responsibility to a container (the DI container).
 * - This inverts the control of dependency creationâ€”from the application code to the container.
 * - This reduces tight coupling between classes.
